There is a great deal of amusing to be had when working in JavaScript. Notwithstanding for engineers that associate with it day by day, a few pieces of the language stay unexplored. I'm going to feature few things you may not think about JavaScript.

## NaN is a number
`NaN` (Not a number) is being a number. Also, `NaN` is not equal to itself. Actually `NaN` not equal to anything. The only way to verify anything is `NaN` or not by `isNaN()`.
```javascript
> typeof(NaN)
"number"

> NaN === NaN
false
```
## null is an object
`null` is an object. Sound odd! Right? But this is fact.
```javascript
> typeof(null)
"object"
```
In case, `null` has no value.  So, `null` should not instance of `Object`.
```javascript
> null instanceof Object
false
```
## undefined can be defined
`undefined` is not a reserved keyword in JavaScript. You can assign value to it. It doesn't through any syntax error. But, you can't assign value anywhere, it return undefined.
```javascript
> var some_var;
undefined
> some_var == undefined
true
> undefined = 'i am undefined'
```
## 0.1 + 0.2 is not equal to 0.3
In JavaScript , `0.1 +0.2 == 0.3` return false. The fact is, how javascript store float number as binary.
```javascript
> 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
> 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
false
```
##  Math.max() smaller than Math.min()
The fact that `Math.max() > Math.min()` returns `false` sounds wrong, but it actually makes a lot of sense.
```javascript
> Math.max() > Math.min()
false
```
If no argument pass via `min()` or `max()` then it return follwoing values.
```javascript
> Math.max()
-Infinity
> Math.min()
Infinity
```
## 018 minus 045 equal to 3
In JavaScript, the prefix  `0`  will convert any number to octal. However,  `8`  is not used in octal, and any number containing an  `8`  will be silently converted to a regular decimal number.
```javascript
> 018 - 045
-19
```
Therefore,  `018 — 017`  is in fact equivalent to the decimal expression  `18 — 37`, because  `045`  is octal but  `018`  is decimal. 

## Functions can  execute itself
Just create a function and immediately call it as we call other functions, with `()` syntax
```javascript
> (function()  { console.log('I am self executing');  })();
I am self executing
```
## Parenthesis position matter
The return statement “does not see” that it has something to return so it returns nothing. Actually, JavaScript put `;` after return.
```javascript
> function foo() {
   return
   {
      foo: 'bar'
   }
}
> foo(); 
undefined
 
> function foo() {
   return {
      foo: 'bar'
   }
}
> foo(); 
{foo: "bar"}
```

## Missing parameter default value
In JavaScript, you can set parameter defaul value in the following way.
```javascript
> function missingParamerCheck(name, age){
    var name = name || 'John Doe'
    var age = age
    console.log(name)
    console.log(age)
}
> missingParamerCheck('', 23)
John Doe
23
> missingParamerCheck('Mike', 18)
Mike
18
```
## Doesn't have integer data type
In JavaScript, there is not `int`(integer) data type. All numbers are `Number` type. Actually it store float value for `int` number in memory level.

## sort() function automatic type conversion
The `sort()` function automatic convert value to string, that why something weired being happened.
```javascript
> [1,5,20,10].sort()
(4) [1, 10, 20, 5]
```

But, it can be fix by comparing.
```javascript
> [1,5,20,10].sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
(4) [1, 10, 20, 5]
```
## Sum of Arrays and Objects
```javascript
> !+[]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]+!![]
9
> {} + []
0
> [] + {}
"[object Object]"
> [] + []
""
> {} + {}
"[object Object][object Object]"
> {} + [] == [] + {}
true
```

Ideally, you discovered some new information or possibly showed signs of improvement comprehension of what is new with these JavaScript pearls.
